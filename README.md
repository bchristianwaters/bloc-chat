## Pull Down the Code

Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Bloc/bloc-frontend-project-starter.git <your-frontend-project-name>
```

## Configuration

The project uses Node to run a JS server in development. This will be important when we want to use urls /album or /collection instead of the basic album.html or collection.html. It may  help to review [our resource on NPM and `package.json` files](https://www.bloc.io/resources/npm-and-package-json).

Install the project dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install
```

## Run the Application

Run the application server:

```
$ npm start
```

The server will start up. To stop the server, press `cntrl + c`.
